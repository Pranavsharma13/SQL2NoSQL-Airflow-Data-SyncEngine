🚀 SQL2NoSQL Airflow Data SyncEngine 

This project showcases end-to-end Data Engineering expertise by designing a scalable SQL & NoSQL database schema and implementing a robust ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow. The project is built on MarketHub: An Online Marketplace, integrating structured transactional data in MySQL with NoSQL analytics in MongoDB, ensuring data consistency, workflow automation, and analytics-ready data storage.

🔹 Project Overview

This project demonstrates real-world Data Engineering skills through a layered architecture:
1️⃣ Database Schema Design: A relational model was built in MySQL to structure e-commerce transactions efficiently (Users, Orders, Payments, Products, etc.).
2️⃣ NoSQL Integration: A MongoDB document store was created to support fast queries & analytics.
3️⃣ ETL Pipeline with Apache Airflow: A fully automated ETL pipeline extracts, transforms, and loads data from MySQL → MongoDB, ensuring data validation, transformation, and workflow orchestration.
4️⃣ Automation & Monitoring: Airflow DAGs are implemented for task dependencies, scheduling, and error handling.

🔹 Core Features

✔ Database Design & Schema Development: A normalized relational schema in MySQL ensures optimized queries, while a flexible NoSQL schema in MongoDB enables efficient analytics.
✔ Airflow DAG-Based ETL: Data is extracted, cleaned, transformed, and loaded using Python & Pandas, ensuring scalable, error-resilient workflows.
✔ Data Quality & Validation: Schema validation, missing data handling, and consistency checks before loading into MongoDB.
✔ Scalability & Performance Optimization: Optimized indexing, partitioning, and parallel task execution for large-scale data handling.
✔ Monitoring & Debugging: Airflow UI integration for task logs, error tracking, and automated alerts.
✔ Real-World Implementation: Demonstrates a practical, production-ready ETL system, integrating SQL and NoSQL data stores with workflow automation.

🔹 Tech Stack & Tools

✅ MySQL – Relational database for structured transactional data
✅ MongoDB – NoSQL database for analytics & flexible querying
✅ Apache Airflow – Workflow automation & scheduling (ETL Orchestration)
✅ Python & Pandas – Data extraction, transformation, and validation
✅ SQLAlchemy & PyMongo – Database connectivity & ORM integration
✅ Docker & Kubernetes – (Future Expansion) for scalable deployments

🚀 ETL Pipeline Workflow

🔹 Extraction: Fetches structured data (Users, Orders, Payments, Products, etc.) from MySQL.
🔹 Transformation: Cleans, aggregates, normalizes, and applies computed fields.
🔹 Loading: Inserts structured data into MongoDB, optimized for analytics.
🔹 Workflow Orchestration: Airflow DAGs manage task execution with dependencies.
🔹 Data Quality Checks: Ensures schema validation, missing values handling, and integrity before insertion.
🔹 Monitoring & Debugging: Logs, error handling, and real-time tracking in Airflow UI.

📌 Future Enhancements

🔹 Real-time streaming with Apache Kafka for continuous data updates.
🔹 ML-powered analytics: Fraud detection, recommendation systems, etc.
🔹 API layer to expose data for real-time applications & dashboards.
🔹 Dashboard & BI Integration using Tableau, Metabase, or Superset.
🔹 Cloud Deployment: Kubernetes/Dockerized Airflow for scalable cloud execution.
